In the summer of 2019, I started a traditional NGO where I hired experts and volunteers to teach do-it-yourself Ayurvedic Exercises to the general public. Co-ordinated volunteer teams and organised 37 seminars across North India to teach Jal Neti, a nasal cleansing technique with long term health benefits, to over 7,000 people. Fundraiser a total amount of $3,000 to employ Gurus to conduct awareness seminars in multiple cities. Executed cross-channel posting across Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn with a total page reach to 2.4 million users. Later, I envisioned that if I could use data analysis to track the impact of Jal Neti on every customer. Throughout this course, everything that I have learnt has equipped me to translate all of my knowldge in my NGO.
