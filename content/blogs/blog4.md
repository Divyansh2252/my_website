title: About me
---

After graduating from London Business School, I initially intend to pursue investment
banking and eventually become an associate in either a private equity or venture capital firm.
While interning in the equity capital market division this past summer, I was able to explore
the various capital fundraising products that investment banks have to offer to clients. I
understood how capital fundraising adds value to businesses. While working on the rights
issue documentation of PVR, I understood how a company that was facing huge losses
besides a high operating leverage due to COVID would be back on track to recapture some
market share. I also gained deeper insight into capital markets and the fundraising industry as
I researched private equity and venture capital investments, their funding amounts,
valuations, and the industry as a whole. This sparked my interest to eventually work in the
private equity or venture capital industry where I aim to combine my investing expertise with
managerial skills and improve businesses around me in addition to generating superior
returns. I believe that the exposure I will gain from working in the ECM division of an
investment bank will equip me to successfully transition into a venture capital or a PE firm. I
see myself working in a multinational investment bank in London that serves ultra-high-networth
individuals, large corporations, and government organizations. I am drawn to the
opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue with diverse clients and connect with their
business at every level. My long-term vision is to leverage my penchant for finance to
educate the financially illiterate in my own country, India. I aim to achieve this by starting an
impactful business where I will attempt to advise middle class families on improving their
personal finances and teach them about investing.
